# Tic_Tac_Toe_PyVersion
Python version of tic tac toe game with single and multiplayer capabilities

## Description
I originally wrote this program in C++, [https://github.com/JayenLare/Tic_Tac_Toe](https://github.com/JayenLare/Tic_Tac_Toe), but re-wrote it in Python in order to better understand and learn the language. This program allows either 1 player or 2 players to play Tic Tac Toe. If there is only 1 player, he/she will play against the computer. Otherwise, the 2 players will play against each other. The program displays an updated board and a position selection menu each turn. The game continues until one of the players gets three in a row or there are no spaces left.
